# GenAICoreTech

This is a textbook on the core technologies of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI). 

An interesting fact is that most of the content was written by the Claude3 language model running on AWS Bedrock.

The [Chinese version](./README_cn.md) takes priority, so please refer to the Chinese README for more details. 

An English version is currently in the planning stages.
